    "From a previous analysis on the transcriptome of Aurelia, it was identified that the expression levels of genes could be clustered into 8 groups. The IDs for the genes within each of these clusters is stored in a file called 'Cluster_IDs.txt'. Based on previous work using Gene Ontology enrichment analyses, it was determined that genes for eye development is enriched in cluster 3. To look at this cluster more closely and perform furter analyses, I have to first subset cluster 3 genes out of the expression counts matrix. This python script is written to perform this function.\n",
