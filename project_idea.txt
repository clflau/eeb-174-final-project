For my final project I plan to create an automated workflow by writing some scripts either in python or in bash to explore the jellyfish Aurelia genome. I will use a bioinfomatic approach to identify orthologs of genes that Aurelia might share with bilaterians, such as genes controlling the development of the heart or limbs. Once identified, I will write a script that would take the genes and use it as quarry to search within the Aurelia stage-specific transcriptome to see their expression patterns in development.


New idea ( 2/17/17)
Start with genes identified for eye development, querry these genes in the Aurelia transcriptome expression data, then use a k-means clustering method to find out which stage of the Aurelia life cycle drives the clustering of these genes

So I have a set of genes that are associated with eye development. I have data for their expression levels. I also have a massive matrix of the expression levels of all the genes in the transcriptome. The transcriptome has been previously analysized based on differential expression analyses across stages. The previous analyses have separated these genes into clusters based on their expression patterns. In particular, GO anaylsis had shown that cluster 3 is enriched in genes involved with eye development. I can separate the genes in cluster 3 into "eye development genes" and "non-eye development genes" and do a discriminant analysis to see if these genes are different in expression patterns.
