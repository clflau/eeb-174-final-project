For my final project I plan to create an automated workflow by writing some scripts either in python or in bash to explore the jellyfish Aurelia genome. I will use a bioinfomatic approach to identify orthologs of genes that Aurelia might share with bilaterians, such as genes controlling the development of the heart or limbs. Once identified, I will write a script that would take the genes and use it as quarry to search within the Aurelia stage-specific transcriptome to see their expression patterns in development.
